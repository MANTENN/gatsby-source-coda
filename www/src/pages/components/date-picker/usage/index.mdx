## Usage

Calendars allow users to select a date or range of dates from a list of days laid out in a month view.

## Anatomy

The Calendar's main functionality is to allow for users to select a date or date range and have visibility into existing calendar details.

## Options

### Default

The caledar renders the current month with no dates selected. Indicator on today is present.

### Selected date

### Disabled date

### Last month

### Strikeout

Pass a set of dates to indicate an event that will be represented by a strike-thru on the dates. TBD (does this disable the date?)

| Common Properties     | Values  | Default Value |
| --------------------- | ------- | ------------- |
| value (selected date) | date    | -             |
| disabledDays          | date    | before today  |
| lastMonth             | date    | -             |
| allowMultiSelection   | boolean | false         |
| daysThemeDotIndicator | date    | -             |
| daysThemeStrikeout    | date    | -             |

## States

The Calendar has many states, but they are all permutaitons of the options above. These states are all possible to generate by changing the options or through user input with the exception of `lastMonth`.

## Visual Specs

Calendars are primarily composed of two groups of elements - the Header and the Date cells. We will separate them here for illustration purposes, but know that they are inseprable in the product. The primary visual specs in both groups are derived from our design tokens.

## Placement & Behavior

In general the calendar component should always be presented with a minimum margin surrounding the component.

<ComponentFooter data={props.data} />

export const pageQuery = graphql`
    {
        # Get links to by path to display in the navbar.
        platformNav: allSitePage(filter: { path: { glob: "/components/date-picker/*/" } }) {
            edges {
                node {
                    ...PlatformNavFragment
                }
            }
        }
        # Get package information by NPM package name.
        packageTable: thumbprintComponent(name: { eq: "@thumbtack/thumbprint-react" }) {
            ...PackageTableFragment
        }
    }
`;
